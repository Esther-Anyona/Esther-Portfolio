    <h3>Photography Website</h3>
    <p>This is a photography website project that i did for a friend. It contains a list of his favorite photos taken during his photography journey. This photographic site serves as his motivation page as it also show cases his progress as a professional photographer. It also gives his prospective clients an overview of what to expect from his services should they engage him. <a href="https://esther-anyona.github.io/epic-shoots/" target="_blank">Epic-Shoots</a></p>
    <h3>Street Food Website</h3>
    <p>In this project, I developed a website for a client who owns a street food restaurant that mainly deals with burgers. Customers were finding it hard to locate the restaurant, make orders and at times missing out on super deals because they couldn't access the restaurant online. Amidst the pandemic and most businesses transiting to online as a result of the lockdown and limited movement, this website helped them make sales and stay afloat as most businesses were going down. <a href="https://esther-anyona.github.io/StreetFood/" target="_blank">Street Food Website</a></p>
    <h3>Mental Health Website</h3>
    <p>Over the past few years, the cases of mental health illnesses especially suicide deaths has been on the rise. This was heightened during the Covid-19 pandemic. A lack of mental wealth awareness has led to an increase in early non-detection of mental illnesses and associated challenges. This is the reason why a group of young professional therapists came up with an organization called MentalCheck, where they could offer their services. However, most people are unable to afford the high fees payable to mental health institutions for assesments and some are unable to access such institutions because of the distance. The MentalCheck website solves these issues by ensuring these therapy services can be accessed from anywhere and by anyone with an internet connection thus reducing the progression of mental illnesses as well as the charges. I developed this website in collaboration with my 3 friends. <a href="https://esther-anyona.github.io/MentalCheck/" target="_blank">Mental Check Website</a></p>
